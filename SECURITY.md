## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Critical Vulnerabilities

For security issues that could lead to remote code execution, privilege escalation,
or other critical vulnerabilities:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
1. Email <othercriteria+ndetect-security@gmail.com>
1. Allow up to 48 hours for initial response

### Standard Security Issues

For other security-related bugs (e.g., path traversal edge cases, symlink handling
issues, error message information leaks):

1. Open a GitHub issue with the "security" label
1. Use the security issue template
1. Avoid including proof-of-concept exploits in the initial public report

## Response Process

We take security seriously and will:

- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Evaluate severity and determine disclosure approach
- Provide regular updates on progress
- Credit reporters (if desired) after fix
